			Summer went away<br>
            Still, the yearning stays<br>
            I play it cool with the best of them<br>
            I wait patiently<br>
            He's gonna notice me<br>
            It's okay, we're the best of friends<br>
            Anyway</p><br><br>

			<p>
			I hear it in your voice<br>
            You're smoking with your boys<br>
            I touch my phone as if it's your face<br>
            I didn't choose this town<br>
            I dream of getting out<br>
            There's just one who could make me stay<br>
            All my days</p><br>
              
			<p>
			From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes<br>
            I waited ages to see you there<br>
            I search the party of better bodies<br>
            Just to learn that you never cared</p><br><br>

			<p>
            You're on your own, kid<br>
            You always have been</p><br>
		

			<p>
			I see the great escape<br>
            So long, Daisy May<br>
            I picked the petals, he loves me not<br>
            Something different bloomed<br>
            Writing in my room<br>
            I play my songs in the parking lot<br>
            I'll run away</p><br>
	



			<p>
			From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes<br>
            I called a taxi to take me there<br>
            I search the party of better bodies<br>
            Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare</p><br>

			<p>You're on your own, kid<br>
            You always have been</p><br>


			<p>
		    From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes<br>
            I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this<br>
            I hosted parties and starved my body<br>
            Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss</p><br>

			<p>
			The jokes weren't funny, I took the money<br>
            My friends from home don't know what to say<br>
            I looked around in a blood-soaked gown<br>
            And I saw something they can't take away</p><br>

            <p>
			You're on your own, kid<br>
            Yeah, you can face this<br>
            You're on your own, kid<br>
            You always have been</p><br>
